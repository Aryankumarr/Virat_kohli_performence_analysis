Unveiling Virat Kohli's Batting Prowess: A Power BI Analysis with Excel

I dove into the world of Virat Kohli's batting brilliance using Excel and Power BI! This project goes beyond basic stats, uncovering insights like:

Format Mastery: Kohli's dominance in the 61-100 run zone across formats, with an impressive average of 77.23.
Overseas Domination: Despite a strong overall average, the analysis reveals Kohli's exceptional ability to score centuries overseas (59% of his ODI tons).
Strike Rate Strategies: Power BI visualizations might show Kohli's strike rate dipping slightly after reaching 150s, a potential area for optimization.
This project is not just about numbers; it's about understanding what makes Kohli tick. By analyzing his performance across teams, grounds, and innings stages, we gain valuable knowledge for cricket fans, analysts, and even Kohli's future endeavors
